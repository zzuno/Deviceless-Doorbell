## üìå Overview

**Deviceless Doorbell** is a minimalist, hardware-free smart doorbell system.  
All it takes is a printed QR code on your front door. Visitors scan it, and you'll instantly receive a notification on your phone.

No buttons. No wiring. Just the cloud.

## ‚ú® Features

- üì± Instant alerts via Matrix / Telegram when QR is scanned
- üåê Hosted via [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- ‚ö° Simple FastAPI backend with webhook trigger
- üß© Integrates with custom Matrix bot (`doorbell_bot`)
- üîí No login, no user data, privacy-first

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. Visitor scans a QR code (located at your door).
2. The QR points to a URL like `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/notify`
3. This triggers a FastAPI server.
4. The server sends an encrypted message to your Element room (Matrix) or a Telegram bot.
5. You get notified: ‚Äúüö™ Someone is at the door!‚Äù

## üñºÔ∏è QR Code

## üß† Idea
‚ÄúWhy install a doorbell when everyone already has a smartphone?‚Äù

This project rethinks the doorbell with software and QR tech. Perfect for offices, shared housing, or minimalists who love frictionless design.
